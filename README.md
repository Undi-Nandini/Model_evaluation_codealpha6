The dataset is taken from the kaggle as winequality-red.csv it contains a columns like fixed acidity	,volatile acidity	,citric acid	,residual sugar	,chlorides	,free sulfur dioxide	,total sulfur dioxide	,density, pH	,sulphates	,alcohol	quality

The overview of a Python script analyzing wine quality using a Random Forest Classifier. It begins with data loading and exploration, followed by visualization of wine quality distribution. The script preprocesses data, splits it into training and testing sets, and trains a Random Forest model. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are calculated and displayed via a classification report. Finally, model performance is visualized with a confusion matrix.
